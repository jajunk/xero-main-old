## Yarn error
Yarn Error. Cannot start yarn project. Node version is incorrect. I need to install a newer version. 

`error react-router-dom@6.4.3: The engine "node" is incompatible with this module. Expected version ">=14". Got "12.22.9"`

## Install a package manager tool to handle yarn installations.

I am not sure how much I am going to be building with yarn down the line. I might be better served installing the minimum to get this done and then move on with my preferred tool set. whatever that might end up being. Although it is an industry standard tool. I should know how to use it. 

### Next Steps
- [ ] DO I want to Continue with yarn or switch to a different tool?
- [ ] Do I want to even continue to build with React. Or am I better off building with an alternative. tool. 

- [ ] Go through files and make my todos
