<br />

#### - Main Points.

<br />

**XeroLinux** adopts the **<a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/hick-s-law-making-the-choice-easier-for-users" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> Hickâ€™s Law </a>** approach when it comes to choices. **Less is More**. So it's up to you shape it into the Distro that fits your needs best.
<br />

**XeroLinux** is targeted towards more *Technical* users. With **Arch** being a more user-involved distribution, basic Linux fundamentals should be known, so when issues *do* happen you will have the tools needed to figure things out on your own. Keep in mind that **XeroLinux** has initial, and limited support only to *XeroLinux-specific* features, such as rices, configs as well as the **XeroTool**. Remember we are a limited team, so assistance can only be offered occasionally. By offering this philosophy it allows for you, the user not to feel too overwhelmed. We recommend playing with **XeroLinux** in a VM before jumping in.
